# ScienceWorld
!!!UNDER CONSTRUCTION!!!


ScienceWorld (Name is not set in stone) is envisioned as a science note-taking application and a Computation software.
The idea is that a user can write notes and add (for example) equations in an "infinite space" (i.e. you have an "infinite" plane where you can drag around) and then connect these equations to other objects to have then connect their inputs and compute.
