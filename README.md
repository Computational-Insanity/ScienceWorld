# ScienceWorld
!!!UNDER CONSTRUCTION!!!

ScienceWorld (Name is not set in stone) is envisioned as a science note-taking application and a Computation software.
The idea is that a user can write notes and add (for example) equations in an "infinite space" (i.e. you have an "infinite" plane where you can drag around) and then connect these equations to other objects to have then connect their inputs and compute.

For information related specifically to the desktop client (this repo)(currently the only planned client), such as implementation details, build instruction, contribution guidelines, etc, go to [this repos wiki](https://github.com/Computational-Insanity/ScienceWorld/wiki).

For more general information, as well as the project documentation, go to the [sister repository](https://github.com/Computational-Insanity/ScienceWorld-Documentation).
